### Most Updated Next.js interview questions : 2024

**1.What is Next.js ?**

- Next.js is react framework for building **_full stack web applications_**. you can use **_react components to build user interfaces_** and next.js for **_additional features and optimizations_** .
- If I have already react.js than why should I use next.js?

**2.What are the features of the next.js?**

- **Routing** : _A file based router_ built on top of server components that supports layouts , nested routing , loading states ,error handling and more .
- **Rendering** : _Client-side and Server-side Rendering_ with Client and Server Components. Further optimized with _Static and Dynamic Rendering_ on the server with Next.js. _Streaming_ on Edge and Node.js runtimes.
- **Data fetching** : _Simplified data fetching_ with async/await in Server Components, and an _extended fetch_ API for request memoization, data caching and revalidation.
- **Styling** : Support for your preferred styling methods, including _CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS_
- **Optmization** : _Image, Fonts, and Script_ Optimizations to improve your application's Core Web Vitals and User Experience.
- **Typescript** : _Improved support_ for TypeScript, with better type checking and more efficient compilation, as well as custom TypeScript Plugin and type checker.

**3.How Does Next.js improve support of typescript?**

- It comes with built-in TypeScript support for automatically installing the **_necessary packages_** and **_configuring_** the proper settings.

  | **Automatic Setup**                   | Comes with built-in TypeScript support, automatically installing necessary packages and configuring settings. For new projects, `create-next-app` ships with TypeScript by default. For existing projects, renaming files to `.ts` or `.tsx` and running `next dev` will automatically install dependencies and generate a `tsconfig.json` file. | Requires manual installation of TypeScript and related packages, and manual setup of `tsconfig.json`.                                             |
  | **TypeScript Plugin**                 | Includes a custom TypeScript plugin for editors like VS Code, offering advanced type-checking, auto-completion, and specific Next.js feature support.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Relies on standard TypeScript plugins without the specialized support for framework-specific features.                                            |
  | **Statically Typed Links**            | Provides static typing for links using `next/link`, preventing typos and ensuring valid routes. The experimental `typedRoutes` feature generates a `.d.ts` file with route information, enhancing link type safety.                                                                                                                              | Requires manual handling and validation of routes without built-in static typing support.                                                         |
  | **End-to-End Type Safety**            | The App Router allows direct data fetching in components, layouts, and pages without serialization, maintaining type safety across server and client boundaries. Simplified data flow with colocated data fetching reduces typing errors and bugs.                                                                                               | Requires manual typing of server-client boundaries and often involves serialization, increasing the complexity and potential for type mismatches. |
  | **Path Aliases and BaseUrl**          | Automatically supports `tsconfig.json` options like "paths" and "baseUrl," simplifying module resolution and import paths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Requires manual configuration and additional setup for similar path aliasing.                                                                     |
  | **Incremental Type Checking**         | Supports incremental type checking, speeding up the process in larger applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Type checking depends on the standard TypeScript setup without the specific optimization for incremental checking.                                |
  | **Type Checking in `next.config.js`** | Allows for type checking using JSDoc in `next.config.js` despite it being a JavaScript file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | No direct support for type checking in configuration files.                                                                                       |
  | **Ignoring TypeScript Errors**        | Fails production builds if TypeScript errors are present, but allows ignoring these errors if needed by configuring `next.config.js`.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | TypeScript errors need to be managed as part of the build process without framework-specific support for ignoring errors.                         |
  | **Custom Type Declarations**          | Provides guidelines for adding custom types without modifying automatically generated files, ensuring custom types are maintained across builds.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Custom type declarations need to be managed manually with potential conflicts in configuration.                                                   |
